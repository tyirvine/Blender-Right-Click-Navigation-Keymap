# Blender Right-Click Navigation Keymap ‚å®
For those that don't really like navigating with the middle mouse button. In this keymap right click can be used to orbit, and still bring up context menus. Middle mouse is now designated to panning.

**Please feel free to contribute to this keymap if you'd like.** I'm fairly active on Github, please just list your changes in the description.
